### Hi there 👋

I am Parul and I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site). Previously I worked as a Data Scientist at [H2O.ai](www.h2o.ai). I combine data science and developer advocacy in my work. I also like to write articles focussed on Data Science and Software development.Im also co-authoring a book on [Machine learning for High Risk Applications](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/machine-learning-for/9781098102425/cover.html).

Here are some of the ways to get to know more about my work:

* ✍🏻 **Blog** : I mostly share my thoughts on data science via my [blog on Medium](https://medium.com/@pandeyparul) where you'll find different articles covering various aspects of the field. You can find these articles organized into different categories [here](https://github.com/parulnith/Data-Science-Articles). Some of my tutorials have been included in the documentation of the libraries :
