### Hi there 👋

I am Parul working as a Data Scientist at [H2O.ai](www.h2o.ai). I combine data science and developer advocacy in my work. I also like to write articles focussed on Data Science and Software development. Here are some of the ways to get to know more about my work:

* ✍🏻 **Blog** : I mostly share my thoughts on data science via my [blog on Medium](https://medium.com/@pandeyparul) where you'll find different articles covering various aspects of the field. You can find these articles organized into different categories [here](https://github.com/parulnith/Data-Science-Articles)

* 💌 **Newsletter** : My [newsletter](http://newsletter.breakingthejargons.com/?via=twitter-profile-webview) contains a roundup of my articles and some useful community resources. You can read the various editions [here](http://newsletter.breakingthejargons.com/?via=twitter-profile-webview)
