### Hi there 👋

I am Parul and I work as a Data Scientist at [H2O.ai](www.h2o.ai). Previously I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site). I combine data science and developer advocacy in my work. I also like to write articles focusing on Data Science and Software development. I have also co-authored a book on [Machine learning for High-Risk Applications](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/machine-learning-for/9781098102425/cover.html).

Here are some of the ways to get to know more about my work:

* ✍🏻 **Blog**: I mostly share my thoughts on data science via my [blog on Medium](https://medium.com/@pandeyparul) where you'll find different articles covering various aspects of the field. You can find these articles organized into different categories [here](https://github.com/parulnith/Data-Science-Articles). Some of my tutorials have been included in the documentation of the libraries. 

* 💌 **Newsletter**: My [newsletter](https://parulpandey.substack.com/)contains a roundup of my articles and some useful community resources. 

* 🎤 **Talks**: I also speak at conferences and Meetups which you can find [here](https://parulpandey.com/talks-2/).
